/**
 * The approval gate's inputs (issue #44).
 *
 * `shouldAutoApprove` used to read an absent or empty checklist as "no gate"
 * and approve on score alone — the same `return true` for a prompt with no
 * questions, a judge that failed to answer them, and answers lost before
 * they were stored. A gate that cannot be performed is not a gate that
 * passed: with no items there is no verdict to derive, and the row stays
 * pending (the zero-item case of ADR 0001's "fewer than three items").
 * The render guard likewise takes a required boolean, because a guard on an
 * optional field the caller may omit is not a guard.
