/**
 * Instrument id and judge identity (issue #36, ADR 0003; issue #58, ADR 0004).
 *
 * Every stored evaluation carries the id of the instrument it was answered
 * under: a name plus a content hash of the WHOLE judging procedure — the
 * template, the response schema, the zoom follow-up's template and schema,
 * the views the follow-up enlarges, and the zoom settings. Two evaluations
 * are comparable only under the same
 * id; one whose id is not the current one is Stale. A hash cannot be
 * forgotten the way a version constant can, and an admin edit to a zoom
 * setting is a new revision because the follow-up is part of the procedure.
 *
 * The specimen is not hashed: the response schema is sized to the checklist
 * asked, so it is hashed at a sentinel size; the follow-up template is hashed
 * unrendered.
 *
 * A judge is qualified per (judge, instrument id), where the judge is the
 * model row with its thinking setting (ADR 0004). `vlm_model` stores only
 * `provider/model_name`, so the effective thinking effort is stamped beside
 * the id to tell two rows of one model apart.
