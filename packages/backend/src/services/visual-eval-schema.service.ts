/**
 * Visual Evaluation Response Schema — guided JSON for the judge
 *
 * Builds the JSON schema the judge's answer must satisfy and decides, per
 * provider, whether to enforce it at decode time.
 *
 * On OpenAI-compatible providers (vLLM) the schema travels as
 * `response_format: {type: "json_schema"}`; vLLM compiles it into a decoding
 * grammar, so a structurally invalid answer cannot occur: no code fences, no
 * missing keys, no invented score, exactly one checklist entry per question
 * asked. Anthropic — the reference judge — is deliberately left
 * unconstrained: its SDK would switch to the structured-outputs beta (or a
 * JSON tool) and the reference would no longer be the reference.
 *
 * The schema sticks to features every vLLM structured-output backend
 * accepts (enum, fixed-length arrays, required, additionalProperties). No
 * numeric ranges, no string formats, no uniqueItems.
 *
 * What guided decoding cannot fix: a reasoning model that spends the whole
 * output budget thinking. vLLM constrains only the text after the reasoning,
 * so an answer that never starts stays empty; visual-eval names that case.
