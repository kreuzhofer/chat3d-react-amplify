/**
 * The qualified judges (issue #58, ADR 0004; issue #62).
 *
 * A judge may rate the corpus that the fine-tuning filter reads only once it
 * has cleared the qualification bar — complete, stable, and on adjudicated
 * disagreements no worse than the reference — and qualification is granted
 * per (Judge, Instrument id). This list is that grant, kept in code beside
 * the instrument and changed by reviewed diff, with the qualification run
 * and the adjudication sheet linked from each entry. Any instrument revision
 * revokes it: a new id matches no entry until the terms are re-run.
 *
 * Each judge is named exactly as production stamps it — `provider/model_name`
 * in `vlm_model` and the effective thinking effort in `vlm_thinking_effort`
 * — so a stored row can be matched to its grant without a lookup. A judge
 * that is not on this list under the current id produces Provisional
 * ratings: kept, gate-derived, excluded from the training export.
